TomRESTTest
===========

This is a REST Jersey/Tomcat 7 maven test.

I'm using netbeans quick servers, based on your port number for tomcat, the curl command might be a bit different: 
curl -u admin:AdminPasswordGoesHere http://localhost:8081/simple-service-webapp/webapi/myresource/admin 

note: there must be a user with role "admin" in tomcat-users.xml
